    What is cybersecurity?
    Cybersecurity refers to any technologies, practices and policies for preventing cyberattacks or mitigating their impact.
    Cybersecurity aims to protect computer systems, applications, devices, data, financial assets and people against
    ransomware and other malware, phishing scams, data theft and other cyberthreats.
    
    At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is a key component of an organization’s overall risk management strategy.
    According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global spending on cybersecurity products and services will exceed USD 1.75
    trillion total during the years 2021 through 2025.1
    
    Cybersecurity job growth is also robust. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that “employment of information
    security analysts is projected to grow 32% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.”2

    Why cybersecurity is important
    Cybersecurity is important because cyberattacks and cybercrime have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses,
    communities and lives. Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of
    sensitive information and business-critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in
    some cases, business closures.
    
    Cyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost
    the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.3 The cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals
    become more sophisticated.
    
    According to IBM's latest Cost of a Data Breach Report:
    
    The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023—a 10% spike and the highest
    increase since the pandemic.
    Business losses (revenue loss due to system downtime, lost customers and reputational damage) and post-breach response
    costs (costs to set up call centers and credit monitoring services for affected customers or to pay regulatory fines),
    rose nearly 11% over the previous year.
    
    The number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines as a result of a data breach rose 22.7% over
    the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%.
    Cybersecurity challenges
    Apart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the
    ever-evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging
    technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for
    threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example:
    
    The pervasive adoption of cloud computing can increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud
    misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.
    More remote work, hybrid work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies mean more connections, devices, applications and
    data for security teams to protect.
    Proliferating Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices, many of which are unsecured or improperly secured by
    default, can be easily hijacked by bad actors.
    
    The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and of generative AI in particular, presents an entirely new threat landscape
    that hackers are already exploiting through prompt injection and other techniques. According to recent research from the
    IBM® Institute for Business Value, only 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured.
    As the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum
    study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap—the gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be
    filled—might reach 85 million workers by 2030.4
    
    Closing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations suffering
    from a high-level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98
    million for organizations with lower-level skills shortages.
    
    Resource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics,
    artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful
    attacks.
    
    Types of cybersecurity
    
    
    
    Comprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organization’s IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats
    and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include:
    
    
    
    AI security
    Critical infrastructure security
    Network security
    Endpoint security
    Application security
    Cloud security
    Information security
    Mobile security
    
    
    
    
    AI security
    
    AI security refers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that
    target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways.
    
    Generative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI
    apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can
    also use (and have already used) generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails.
    
    AI security uses specialized risk management frameworks—and increasingly, AI-enabled cybersecurity tools—to protect the
    AI attack surface. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations that deployed AI-enabled security
    tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD 2.2 million lower average cost per breach compared
    to organizations with no AI deployed.
    
    
    Critical infrastructure security
    
    Critical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a
    society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety.
    
    In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help
    IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure.5 The US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity
    and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.6
    
    
    Network security
    
    Network security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that
    authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.Network security is the field of cybersecurity focused on protecting computer networks and systems from internal and
    external cyberthreats and cyberattacks.
    
    Network security has three chief aims: to prevent unauthorized access to network resources; to detect and stop
    cyberattacks and security breaches in progress; and to ensure that authorized users have secure access to the network
    resources they need, when they need them </p>
